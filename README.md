# GitHub Finder

A React.js app to search GitHub profiles and see profile details. This app uses the Context API along with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management and is part of the "React Front To Back" Udemy course from [Brad Traversy](https://traversymedia.com)'s.

I have used TailwindCSS & DaisyUI to make it look more user-friendly and modern.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
